description: Chew through CodeRabbit's review comments on a PR — fetch them all, parse the severity line, drop Trivial/Minor into a "skipped, with reason" list, verify Major and above against the current code, show a fix / don't-fix plan, and apply only after approval. Use when the user asks to process, triage, or address CodeRabbit comments on a PR.

# CodeRabbit

## Arguments

Raw arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- A number → that PR. If absent, resolve the PR for the current branch with `gh pr view --json number,headRepositoryOwner,headRepository,url`. If there is no PR, say so and stop.
- `--all` → give 🔵 Trivial the same reading 🟡 Minor gets.

Get `OWNER/REPO` from `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` unless the argument carries its own.

## Goal

Every CodeRabbit finding on the PR gets an explicit disposition — **fixed**, **skipped (with reason)**, or **rejected (with reason)**. Nothing falls off the list silently. The count you report must equal the count you fetched.

## Instructions

### 1. Fetch

```bash
gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/N/comments?per_page=100" --paginate
gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/N/comments?per_page=100" --paginate
```

The first call returns inline review comments (where the findings live); the second returns the walkthrough / summary comments (where CodeRabbit sometimes parks extra findings in a collapsed "Outside diff range" or "Nitpick" section — read those bodies too, they contain findings that never became inline comments).

Keep only comments whose `user.login` starts with `coderabbitai`. Record for each: `id`, `path`, `line` (or `original_line`), `body`, `in_reply_to_id`.

Drop replies (`in_reply_to_id` set) and any comment already marked resolved or outdated — but **count them in the total** and list them under skipped as `already resolved`.

### 2. Parse severity

Each finding opens with a machine-readable line:

```
_🎯 Functional Correctness_ | _🟠 Major_ | _⚡ Quick win_
_📐 Maintainability & Code Quality_ | _🔵 Trivial_ | _⚡ Quick win_
```

→ category | severity | effort. Severity ladder, low to high: `🔵 Trivial` < `🟡 Minor` < `🟠 Major` < `🔴 Critical`.

If a comment has no such line, infer from its heading (`⚠️ Potential issue` → Major, `🛠️ Refactor suggestion` / `🧹 Nitpick` → Minor) and mark the severity `(inferred)` in the report.

Also pull out of the body, when present:
- the suggested diff (```suggestion block or fenced diff)
- the **Prompt for AI Agents** block — it's the finding restated for you, use it

### 3. Sort

Severity budgets how much scrutiny a finding earns — it never decides whether
the finding is right. A correct, cheap Minor gets fixed; a wrong Major gets
rejected.

- 🔵 Trivial → **skipped** by default, one line each with the reason. No
  verification, no reading files.
- 🟡 Minor → **read it, then decide.** Skip when it is taste, when the project
  has a settled convention the bot does not know, or when the fix costs more
  than the defect is worth. Fix when it is correct and the change is small and
  self-contained — "it is only Minor" is not a reason to leave a real defect in
  the branch. Report which you chose and why; `below severity threshold` is not
  a reason on its own.
- 🟠 Major, 🔴 Critical → **verify** each one against current code.
- `--all` → give 🔵 Trivial the same reading 🟡 Minor gets.

### 4. Verify each Major+ against the current code

Read the file at the referenced path and line **as it is now**. The comment may be stale — the code may have moved, already been fixed, or the bot may simply be wrong.

Decide one of:
- **fix** — the problem is real and still present
- **already fixed** — the code no longer has it
- **reject** — the bot is wrong, or the suggestion breaks something else. Say concretely why.

Ponytail applies to the fix itself: take the smallest correct change, not necessarily the bot's suggested diff.

### 5. Show the plan, then stop

```
## CodeRabbit — PR #16 (7 findings)

### Fixing (3)

**1. src/rules/loader.ts:41** — 🟠 Major · Functional Correctness
Empty rule file silently yields an empty ruleset instead of erroring.
→ throw on empty parse result

**2. src/cli.ts:88** — 🔴 Critical · Security
Path from argv joined without normalising; escapes the rules dir.
→ resolve and assert prefix

**3. src/cli.ts:34** — 🟡 Minor · Functional Correctness
`--limit` parsed with `parseInt`, so `--limit 5x` silently becomes 5.
→ correct and one line; `Number()` + isFinite check

### Not fixing (1)

**4. src/rules/loader.ts:12** — 🟠 Major · Performance
Claims the regex is recompiled per call; it's module-level const. Bot is wrong.

### Skipped (3)

5. src/cli.ts:20 — 🔵 Trivial · Trivial, skipped by default
6. README.md:8 — 🟡 Minor · read it: wants the options table alphabetised, the
   order is grouped by workflow on purpose
7. src/index.ts:5 — 🟠 Major · already fixed on this branch

7 findings, 3 to fix. Apply?
CODERABBIT gate: OPEN — 7 findings, 3 fixes awaiting approval.
```

Wait for approval. Then apply the approved fixes with `Edit`, and report what changed.

### 6. Gate line

Every output ends with a machine-readable last line, exactly one of:

- `CODERABBIT gate: PASS — N findings, N dispositioned.` (every finding fixed, skipped or rejected — nothing left to do)
- `CODERABBIT gate: OPEN — N findings, M fixes awaiting approval.` (the plan in step 5, before the user answers)
- `CODERABBIT gate: BLOCKED — N findings, M undispositioned.` (the arithmetic didn't close, or the user declined a fix that is still a real defect — name them)

It exists so a driving agent, PR template or hook can check the step ran and closed without re-parsing the report.

## Rules

- **Never post to the PR.** No replies, no resolves, no reactions, no `gh pr comment`. Read-only against GitHub.
- **The arithmetic must close.** Fixing + not fixing + skipped = findings fetched. Print the total in the heading and re-check it before showing the plan — a finding that appears in no section is exactly the failure this skill exists to prevent.
- **Skipped is a list, not a count.** One line per skipped finding with its path and reason, even for Trivial.
- **Number every finding sequentially across the whole report** — Fixing, then Not fixing, then Skipped, never restarting per section. The last number equals the total in the heading, and "apply 3 and 7" means exactly two findings. Keep the same numbers when you report what changed after approval.
- **Severity budgets attention, not belief.** A Minor is skipped because you
  read it and judged the change not worth making, never because of its label.
- **Verify before believing.** A Major finding still gets read against current code; the bot reviews a snapshot, the branch has moved.
- **The environment is not a finding.** A fact about where the diff lands — repo conventions, a missing CI job, how downstream consumes the change — is not a defect in the diff and never holds the gate `BLOCKED`. Close the gate on the findings and report the environment fact separately, below the gate line.
- **No fixes before approval.** Steps 1–4 change nothing on disk.
- **Rejections need a concrete reason** — what the bot missed, not "not applicable".
- **Fix the cause, not the line.** If the same finding pattern hits three files and the bot flagged one, fix all three and say so.
- **No preamble.** Start with the `## CodeRabbit — PR #N` heading.
- **Always end with the gate line.** It's the step's result and the only line the driving agent needs.
