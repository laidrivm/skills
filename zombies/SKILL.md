description: Suggest tests worth writing for a feature using the ZOMBIES heuristic (Zero, One, Many, Boundaries, Interface, Exceptions, Simple scenarios). Pass a free-text feature description, or omit args to use the current branch's diff. Outputs only the categories that apply — not a full ZOMBIES checklist. Use when the user asks what tests to write, and proactively after implementing a feature to surface test gaps.

# ZOMBIES

## Arguments

Raw arguments: $ARGUMENTS

If the arguments start with `--base <branch>`, use `<branch>` as the base branch and treat the rest as the feature description. Otherwise treat all arguments as a **free-text feature description** (e.g. "sign-in code login flow", "image upload validation") and locate the relevant code and tests yourself using `Grep`/`Glob`.

If no base branch was given, detect the default branch with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD` (strip the `origin/` prefix); if that fails, fall back to `main`. Call the result `<base>`.

If no feature description remains, run `git diff <base>...HEAD` and use the diff as the feature scope.

## Goal

Identify the **most valuable tests to write** for the feature, using ZOMBIES as a thinking tool. The output is a list of test ideas the user can stub out themselves — **do not write or stub the tests**.

ZOMBIES stands for:

- **Z**ero — no inputs / empty state
- **O**ne — a single input / the happy path
- **M**any — multiple inputs, ordering, pagination, concurrency
- **B**oundaries — limits, off-by-one, min/max lengths, timing edges, type edges
- **I**nterface — the contract/shape of the public API (return types, status codes, redirects)
- **E**xceptions — invalid input, failures, expired/used/missing state, auth failures
- **S**imple scenarios — the common everyday usage paths a real user takes

**Skip categories that don't apply.** A read-only endpoint may have nothing under "Many". A pure validator may have nothing under "Interface". Only list tests that are genuinely worth writing — quality over coverage.

### Interface prompts

When weighing the **I** letter for an HTTP/JSON endpoint, check the contract against these (skip any that don't apply):

- Is every contract key present even when its value is null (no keys that vanish)?
- Do enums arrive as strings, booleans as true/false, dates as ISO 8601 with offset?
- Is the casing consistent across the whole payload, including error bodies and pagination metadata?
- Does an error response carry a machine-readable `code` (and `action` where the user can act), not just a message string?
- Are status codes right for the failure class (validation → 4xx, never 500)?

**Only when the feature ships UI components** — the UI's contract with assistive technologies is also an interface. Check:

- Is every interactive element reachable and operable by keyboard alone?
- Are state changes (loading, success, error, expiry) announced — `role="status"`, or `role="alert"` for genuinely urgent ones?
- Does the element appear in the accessibility tree with the right role and an accessible name (label / alt)?

If the diff contains no UI, skip this block silently.

### Layer routing

Each suggestion belongs to a test layer:

- **Z / O / M / B / I / E** letters → unit or integration tests by default.
- **S (Simple scenarios)** describing a user-facing journey through the UI → mark the bullet with the suffix `(e2e candidate)`; these belong in the e2e smoke suite. An S bullet that is exercisable through the API alone stays unmarked (integration).

## Instructions

### 1. Locate the feature

- **With args**: search the codebase with `Grep`/`Glob` for files matching the description. Read the implementation files (controllers, models, actions, validators) and the existing test file if one exists.
- **Without a description**: run `git diff --name-status <base>...HEAD` and `git diff <base>...HEAD`, then read the changed implementation files. Skip auto-generated files — the shared list of patterns lives in `../_shared/generated-files.md` (relative to this SKILL.md); if unavailable, fall back to lockfiles, compiled assets, generated route/type definitions.

### 2. Generate ZOMBIES suggestions

For each ZOMBIES letter, ask: *is there a test here that would catch a real bug or document real behaviour?* If yes, list it. If no, skip the letter. For the I letter, walk the Interface prompts above; for the S letter, apply Layer routing.

**Cross-reference against the existing test file.** This skill outputs tests *to write*, not a coverage map — so:

- **Skip behaviours already fully covered** by an existing test. A covered behaviour is not a test to write; listing it buries the gaps that matter.
- **Keep a behaviour that's only partially covered** — where a test exercises it but misses an important assertion (e.g. asserts a successful login redirect but never checks the code is consumed). Prefix the bullet with `[partial]` and name the missing assertion.
- When unsure whether a test covers a behaviour, keep the bullet rather than dropping it — a false "already covered" silently hides a real gap. Prefix such bullets with `[verify coverage]` so the user can tell a certain gap from a possible one.

Suggestion quality bar:

- **Specific, not generic.** "Test maximum email length (255 chars)" beats "Test boundaries".
- **Reference real values from the code** when possible — column lengths from migrations, expiry windows from config, validation rules from FormRequests.
- **One test per bullet.** Don't combine "test A and B" into one line.
- **Phrase as a behaviour to verify**, not as a method name. "Expired sign-in code returns 422" beats "test_expired_code".

### 3. Output the report

Group by feature area first (if the diff covers multiple features), then by ZOMBIES letter within each. **Letters always appear in ZOMBIES order — Zero, One, Many, Boundaries, Interface, Exceptions, Simple.** Skipping a letter never reorders the rest: the letters you do show must still run top-to-bottom in that fixed sequence (e.g. show Boundaries before Interface before Exceptions, even if Zero, One, and Many were all skipped). Use this format exactly:

In each feature heading, name the test file the ideas belong in — the existing test file you cross-referenced, or the conventional path for a new one (this names a destination, not implementation hints). `(e2e candidate)` bullets belong in the e2e suite regardless of the heading's file.

```
## 🧟 [Feature Area] (tests/Feature/SignInCodeTest.php)

**Boundaries**
- Email field rejects values longer than 255 chars (matches migration column)
- Sign-in code expires exactly at the 15-minute mark

**Interface**
- Error for an expired code carries code "code_expired", not only a message string
- `expiresAt` is returned as ISO 8601 with offset

**Exceptions**
- Expired code returns a validation error
- Already-used code cannot be redeemed twice
- Submitting code for an unknown email fails silently (no user enumeration)

**Simple**
- Requesting a code emails the user and creates a `SignInCode` row
- User signs in end-to-end: request code → follow email → land authenticated (e2e candidate)
- [partial] valid code logs the user in — existing test asserts the redirect but never asserts the code is consumed
```

The `🧟` prefix and `##` level are what make a feature heading stand out from the bold `**Letter**` sub-headings — keep both. If multiple features are in scope, repeat the block per feature, separating each with a `---` horizontal rule so the boundaries between features are obvious.

End with a one-line summary: `X test ideas (Y e2e candidates).` — omit the parenthesis when there are none.

If there's nothing worth testing (e.g. trivial rename, pure config change), output exactly:

```
✅ Nothing worth writing tests for.
```

## Rules

- **Don't stub the tests.** This skill outputs ideas only — the user writes the tests.
- **Skip ZOMBIES letters that don't apply.** Do not write "(none)" placeholders. Quality over coverage.
- **Gaps only.** Skip behaviours an existing test already fully covers. Keep partially-covered behaviours, prefixed with `[partial]` and naming the missing assertion. When unsure, keep the bullet prefixed with `[verify coverage]` — never silently drop a real gap.
- **Name the target test file** in each feature heading — existing file or conventional path for a new one.
- **Route by layer.** Mark UI-journey Simple scenarios with `(e2e candidate)`; never mark other letters with it.
- **Always preserve ZOMBIES order.** The displayed sections must follow Zero → One → Many → Boundaries → Interface → Exceptions → Simple. Skipping letters is fine; reordering the remaining ones is not.
- **One heading per letter, per feature area.** Each ZOMBIES letter appears at most once within a feature area — collect all of that letter's bullets under its single heading. Never repeat a letter's heading.
- **Be specific.** Reference actual lengths, timings, statuses, route names from the code. Generic suggestions are worthless.
- **One behaviour per bullet.** No "and" joining two tests.
- **No implementation hints.** Don't suggest assertions, factories, or test setup — just what to verify.
- **Group by feature first, then by letter.** Don't dump everything under one giant ZOMBIES list when the diff spans multiple features.
- **No preamble.** No "Here are the tests I'd suggest…". Start with the first `## [Feature Area]` heading.
- **No closing advice** beyond the summary line.
