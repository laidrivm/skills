# Code Review

## Context

**Staged diff:**

!`git diff --cached`

**Recent commits (for context):**

!`git log --oneline -10`

## Arguments

Raw arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the arguments as follows:

- **Agent** (optional, first argument): must be one of exactly these literals — `claude`, `self`, `codex`, `aider`, `goose`. Anything else is not an agent.
  - `claude` / `self` / empty — perform the review directly in this context (default)
  - `codex` / `aider` / `goose` — delegate via Bash (see Delegation section)
- **Feature** (optional, remaining arguments after agent): A description of what part of the codebase to review (e.g. "voting functionality", "authentication", "API endpoints"). When provided, find and review all files related to this feature. When empty/omitted, review staged changes instead.

If the first argument is not one of those five literals, treat the whole of `$ARGUMENTS` as the **feature**, with agent defaulting to `claude`. Never derive a command name from `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Instructions

### Determine what to review

1. **If a feature is specified** — use Glob and Grep to find all files related to the described feature. Read those files and review them as existing code.
2. **If no feature is specified and there are staged changes** — review the staged diff shown above.
3. **If no feature is specified and there are NO staged changes** — tell the user: "Nothing to review. Either stage changes with `git add` or specify a feature to review, e.g. `/code-review voting functionality`." Then stop.

### Perform the review

Read surrounding source files as needed to understand context. Organize findings by file, then by severity.

### Severity levels

1. **🔴 Critical** — Bugs, security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, or crashes. Must be fixed.
2. **🟠 Error** — Logic errors, missing error handling, broken edge cases. Very likely to cause problems.
3. **🟡 Warning** — Code smells, performance concerns, potential edge cases, maintainability issues.
4. **🔵 Suggestion** — Better approaches, readability improvements, idiomatic alternatives.
5. **⚪ Nitpick** — Style, naming, formatting, minor preferences. Totally optional.

### Output format

Group findings by severity. Each severity level that has findings should be its own heading (e.g. `## 🔴 Critical`, `## 🟠 Error`, etc.). Within each severity heading, list the findings. For each finding, include:
- The file and line reference
- A concise description of the issue
- A suggested fix or alternative (when applicable)

Omit severity headings that have no findings.

End with a `## Summary` section: overall assessment, whether changes look good to merge (or code looks healthy), and a count of findings per severity level.

### Delegation

Only for agent `codex`, `aider`, or `goose`:
- Write the prompt (review instructions, severity levels, output format, and the staged diff or feature description) to a file in the scratchpad directory using Write — never inline user text into the command line
- Run exactly one of: `codex -q "$(cat <prompt-file>)"`, `aider -q "$(cat <prompt-file>)"`, `goose -q "$(cat <prompt-file>)"`
- When the command returns, relay its findings to the user verbatim
